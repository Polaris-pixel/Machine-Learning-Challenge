# Machine Learning Challenge

Project Objective

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

The purpose of this project was to craete multiple machine learning models and compare them to identify the best model for classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.
